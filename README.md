# Breadth-First-Search
Breadth First Search Project

NOTES: 
1. The programs were ran and tested on linux machines.
2. MyBST, SubwayDriver, and SubwayGraph were written in Java using the Eclipse IDE

How to Run:
1. Use the command 'make' or 'make all'
2. Then run the scripts test.sh and test2.sh
3. Notice that the scripts run the inputs under the directory test_input and runs a diff on the output in the test_output directory which      were provided in the assignment.
 

Example                                                                                                             
'make all'                                                                                                     
'./test.sh'
'./test2.sh'

In both scripts, nothing should be printed since we are running a diff on the output.
